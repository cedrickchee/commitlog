# commitlog

Commitlog is a distributed commit log service.

## Build a Log Package

Logs—which are sometimes also called _write-ahead logs_, _transaction logs_, or
_commit logs_—are at the heart of storage engines, message queues, version
control, and replication and consensus algorithms. As you build distributed
services, you'll face problems that you can solve with logs.
